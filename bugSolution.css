To avoid unexpected results, ensure that the calculation within `calc()` results in a positive value. If you need to calculate a difference that might result in a negative value, consider using `max()` or `min()` to constrain the result to non-negative values.

For example, instead of `width: calc(50px - 100%);` which might produce undesired negative values and cause layout issues, consider using `width: max(0, calc(50px - 100%));` which will always result in a non-negative value.   You should also maintain unit consistency throughout your `calc()` expression to avoid unexpected conversions.

The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you don't carefully consider operator precedence and unit consistency. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 50px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50px - 100%);` might not behave as you expect, as it calculates a negative value which might cause layout issues.
